System Settings

Every eCommerce system will have settings. Settings will be used to toggle features on/off, turn features on by percentage, etc.

Settings in PHP eCommerce will be simple key/value pairs. Anything else can be part of a config. (API keys and pass phrases, etc.)

First lets plan the settings table, as our setting table will be cached heavily and queried seldom, we can make all the settings one table.

Use cases for settings are as a toggle (0/1) or percentage (0-100) 0 being off and 100 being fully on.

The columns will be as follows
id - auto increment
setting_name (varchar 200) Primary Key
setting (tinyint) unsigned (we don't need negative numbers)

Index will be on setting_name
