This is a place where I am going to write the stuff on my mind, Stuff about programming, marketing, ecommerce, etc.

A few days ago I bought PHPeCommerce.com and am going to start hacking up some code to make into an ecommerce script. I have written a few ecommerce sites before and feel I know the realm of online business pretty well.

Thinking about this more I have decided that it isn't about anyone using the script, or making money off any of this; This project I am starting is a big metaphore. I have a lot of shit in my head, I need to put it out there since ecommerce is the thing that drove me into professional programming and learning PHP to a higher level and my passion, it is the metaphore I will use in every example I give.

PHP eCommerce might not ever turn into a commercially usable product, but it will have a lot of good open source tools for building highly scalable and usable tools.
